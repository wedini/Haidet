3 The 7 is the permission for the user which gives the user to read wirte and execute, the 5 is for the owner which gives the owner read and execute permission, and the 0 is for group which blocks group from all three permissions.

4 ls /usr/bin/ | grep  /*zip$

5 head -12 /etc/passwd |tail -1

6 tar -cvzf ~/homedir.tar.gz ~/

7 if we type ls -l <filename> and the first thing on the description is "l" then the file is a symbolic link

8 apt-get install <program name>

9 cut -d':' -f1 /etc/passwd

10 cut -d':' -f1 /etc/passwd | head  

11 chown <new Owner> <Filename>

12 mv *.java /tmp

13 diff basically compares files line by line and gets their difference. So for instance if a file needs an update we can use diff to compare the old file with the update one and once we get the difference we can use patch to patch the old file with the updates.
